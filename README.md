This is the repository of the first assessment for the Intro to SWE course, thaught by Prof. Art Sedighi

Problem statement:  You are being asked to build a marketplace to sell a type of product and only that type of product. For example, a market place to sell vegetables, or a marketplace to sell computer parts, etc.    

 

The project runs the entire semester, and consists of four parts.   Each group will have two sets of students: developers and stakeholders.  The students that acts as stakeholders for one part, become developers in the next part; and so on.  The roles switch in order to ensure continuity and proper knowledge transfer. 

 

 

Part 1: Requirements Analysis and Specification
Objectives: Identify functional and non-functional requirements, create use cases and user stories, develop a requirements specification document, and introduce Git for version control.

 

Tasks and Roles:

Stakeholder Interviews:
Stakeholders: Identify key stakeholders, conduct interviews, and gather requirements.
Developers: Assist in formulating interview questions, document gathered requirements, and provide technical insight during interviews.
 

Use Case Diagram:
Stakeholders: Provide scenarios and examples of how users will interact with the system.
Developers: Create the use case diagram based on stakeholder input, ensuring technical feasibility.
 

User Stories:
Stakeholders: Write detailed user stories for key functionalities, focusing on user needs and business value.
Developers: Review and refine user stories to ensure they are technically achievable and clear.
 

Requirements Document:
Stakeholders: Ensure all business and user requirements are captured and accurately reflected.
Developers: Compile the comprehensive requirements specification document, integrating both functional and non-functional requirements.
 

Git Setup:
Stakeholders: Collaborate with developers to commit initial documents and understand basic Git commands.
Developers: Set up the Git repository and guide stakeholders on using Git for version control.
